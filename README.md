# vue_todolist
This is my own application which helps organising things to do. It's very simple app, I made it for exercise VueJS.

 Functionalities I have used:
- sending and receiving data to and from components
- changing variable values and deleting items in array
- vue routing
- v-model, v-bind, v-if, v-else, v-style, v-on etc.
- custom CSS
